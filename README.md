## Overview
During this training phase, I undertook various tasks and assignments to enhance my skills and knowledge. This repository serves as a comprehensive log of the work accomplished, providing a reference for my progress and achievements.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Logic Building 
- Objective: During this task, I focused on enhancing my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking by creating detailed flowcharts for a set of Java programming problems. The goal was to visually represent the logic and control flow of each solution before diving into coding. This exercise helped me improve my understanding of algorithmic structures and how to translate them into Java code.

### Task 2:  HTML and CSS Login Page Design 
- Objective: Developed and designed a static Login Page using HTML and CSS only.
- The design of the page is attached below:

- Folder name: HTML

### Task 3: JavaScript Promise
- Objective: The task is the assignment is as follows:
    1. Create an IIFE function that contains an array and firstElement variable. Assign the 1st element of the array to firstElement.
    2. Create another function called "two" and it should be called in the first function. Calculate the sum of the array elements.
    3. Create a custom promise that contains an array called "img". If the sum in the second function is greater than 30, then the promise should fetch the images equal to the sum and it should be displayed in the browser.

### Task 4: Javascript Recursion Practice Problems
- Objective: This task consists of 3 programs:
    1. Calculate nCr using recursion: main -> comb -> fact
    2. Store and display all elements of an array using recursion.
    3. Store the Fibonacci Series and find prime nos. Find differences of prime nos and add the differences using recursion.
